              Europe’s Greens, big winners in Sunday’s European elections, will
              use their newfound leverage in a fractured parliament to push an
              agenda of urgent climate action, social justice and civil
              liberties, the movement’s leaders say. “This was a great outcome
              for us – but we now also have a great responsibility, because
              voters have given us their trust,” Bas Eickhout, a Dutch MEP and
              the Greens’ co-lead candidate for commission president, told the
              Guardian. “Our voters, especially the younger generation, for many
              of whom we are now their first choice, are deeply concerned about
              the climate crisis, and they are pro-European – but they feel the
              EU is not delivering. They want us to change the course of
              Europe.” Sign up to the Green Light email to get the planet's most
              important stories Read more Riding a surge of public concern over
              the climate crisis, Greens achieved double-digit scores in several
              countries, finishing second in Germany – where they doubled their
              previous score – and Finland and third in Luxembourg and France.
              With their tally of MEPs surging to 70 from 51 in the last
              parliament, the Greens group will have roughly the same clout in
              the 751-seat assembly as the far-right populists led by Italy’s
              interior minister, Matteo Salvini – and a much better chance of
              using it. The parliament’s shrinking centre-right and centre-left
              groups lost their longstanding joint majority in the election,
              meaning that along with liberal MEPs, Greens could prove critical
              to achieving broad pro-EU majorities to pass European legislation.
              The big parties are certainly ready to talk. Manfred Weber, the
              conservative European People’s party’s lead candidate for
              commission president, said on Monday that the Greens were clearly
              “a possible partner. We should sit down together and draft a
              mandate for the next five years.

              change of attitude: a price on C02, properly tackling aviation,

              Under the 2015 Paris deal to limit global warming to well below 2C
              above pre-industrial levels, the 28-nation EU has pledged by 2030
              to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% below the levels
              in 1990. But scientists and activists say Europe and all other
              major economies must sharply raise their ambitions. The UN
              Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change warned in October that
              warming is currently on track towards a catastrophic 3C or 4C
              rise. An NBA star, a TV chef and a comedian: meet some of the new

              protection and reducing inequality in Europe,” Eickhout added.
              “And we will demand far more vigorous action on the rule of law –
              no more playing politics. So those are the topics. We’ll talk to
              all who are interested in addressing them.” Sven Giegold, a senior
              German MEP, confirmed the party would “insist on negotiating
              substance first. We aim to negotiate a pro-EU agenda in which
              climate change policy is front and centre – and no longer just
              symbolic, but concrete.” Any cross-party agreement with Green
              backing would also need to include an EU policy on investment and
              social cohesion, Giegold said, plus an absolute commitment to
              tackling civil rights backsliding in EU states including Hungary,
              Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Malta. “We think these election
              results give us a higher legitimacy to make these demands,”
              Giegold said. “Parliament now needs to have the time to sit down
              and discuss all this. We need to see more EU democracy come from
              this, not less.” Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP and leader
              of the Greens’ group in the European parliament, also warned that
              the party would not enter into alliances unless the contain
              concrete measures.

              Cyberpunk 2077 was announced way back in 2012, and the past seven
              years of news paint CD Projekt's sci-fi RPG as a behemoth of a
              game, even bigger than The Witcher 3. Like The Wild Hunt,
              Cyberpunk 2077 is first and foremost an RPG, quest director
              Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz said recently in an interview with
              AreaJugones, with "a strong narrative component" leading its FPS
              combat. At E3 2018 PC Gamer was among the first to sit down and
              watch an hour-long demo that showed off a dizzying variety of
              Cyberpunk's systems, character progression, and combat. As for E3
              2019, CD Projekt RED says will be the company's "most important"
              E3 ever but later clarified that the public still won't be getting
              hands-on with the game. When is Cyberpunk 2077 coming out? What
              will its story be like? Will it really look that good? Here's
              everything we know about Cyberpunk 2077 so far. Cyberpunk 2077
              release date CD Projekt hasn't given a date. The developers have
              given a range, but it's a wide one: we know that it plans to
              release Cyberpunk 2077 between 2017 and 2021, along with another
              unannounced RPG. Our guess is that Cyberpunk 2077 will release in
              2019, and a deleted tweet from a Turkish publisher alluded to a
              2019 release date. CD Projekt is targeting the current generation
              of consoles in addition to PC. That only gives the team so much
              time to get it out the door. If you want even more support, the
              2019 guess is backed up by comments from a March 2017 financial
              results conference during which CD Projekt developers said that
              progress on Cyberpunk is "quite advanced." That said, the "when
              it's done" motto is something CD Projekt is serious about (The
              Witcher 3 was delayed, and that turned out pretty well, in the
              end).

              In a recent video from Playstation, going behind the scenes of
              Cyberpunk's development, the devs said "Cyberpunk 2077 may no
              longer be the mystery it once was, but work on it is far from
              over."

              Who knows that means—it could point to a late 2019 release, or
              much later. Another point of speculation: The head writer left CD
              Projekt RED for Blizzard in early 2019. It's not for sure, but
              that may mean that the story and dialogue are fully locked-in at
              this point. Will Cyberpunk 2077 be at E3 2019? Yes! Cyberpunk 2077
              will be at E3 2019 for what CD Projekt RED says will be the
              company's "most important" E3 ever. Attendees still won't be able
              to get hands on a mouse or controller to play, but you can still
              see a bit of action in a demo presentation if you're willing to
              wait in line. The game will be demoed at the South Hall in the LA
              Convention Center, booth 1023, on June 11-13th. Cyberpunk 2077's
              E3 2018 gameplay demo Here it is, the video we were waiting for:
              48 minutes of Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay, with some VO explaining
              what's going on. Further down in this article, you'll find what we
              learned from viewing a slightly different version of this demo at
              E3 2018, as well as other details from interviews and news stories
              spanning the past several years. Also, check out Andy's
              impressions of this same demo, played slower with more time to
